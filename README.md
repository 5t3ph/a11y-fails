## Find the fails!

How many accessibility (a11y) fails can you find?

There are fails of all the following:

- users with visual impairments
- users of assistive technology
- users with motion sensitivities
- users who perform keyboard interaction

Fork the repo and create a pull request to submit your fixes! You can use tools like aXe but be aware that _not all issues_ are detectable via tools.

For hints and to learn more about what it means to create accessible experiences, check out my article [Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://dev.to/5t3ph/introduction-to-web-accessibility-5cmp).

## Check your answers
